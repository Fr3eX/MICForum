	-HandlerInterceptors are used to perform actions before,after handling of a request also after a completion(when the view is rendered).It has the same concept of a filter
		the only difference resides on where it interferes.
		
		
		HandlerInterceptor interface contains three main methods :
			-postHandle()
			-preHandle()
			-afterCompletion()
			
	The main difference between HandlerInterceptor and HandlerInterceptorAdapter is that in the first one we need override all three methods whereas in the second
	we may implement only required method.
	
	-HandlerInterceptor is registered to the DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping bean, which is responsible for applying interceptors 
	to any class marked with a @Controller annotation. Moreover, you may specify any number of interceptors in your web application
	
	-HandlerInterceptorAdapter is Deprecated since spring 5.3
