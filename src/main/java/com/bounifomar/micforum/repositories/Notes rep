-When you are writing a @Repository bean, you would normally inject there a DataSource or an EntityManager. 
 DataSource.getConnection() method should be thread safe. With regard to EntityManager, Spring will inject a proxy which will behave differently for different threads,
	i.e. different threads won't share the same JPA session.
